# Glass
For when you want Discord *entirely* transparent.
## How it looks on top of applications;

### Notes;
Transparency needs to be enabled in settings for this to work properly, or usage of a custom background or compatible client will suffice.
You can set a custom background manually by editing the CSS & providing a valid url.
Theme has minor visual issues in Light mode, I suggest switching to Dark mode.
